### *Weather App*

In this tutorial ([facebook-phappham](https://www.facebook.com/Kirapham)),  I am gonna showing to you how to code a weather app with javascript. in this tutorial also we use a weather api and we get data from api❗️

## *Warning*

You need to get your own api key (in video we showed how!) and replace it in index.js file on line 9 :

```javascript
const APIKey = 'Nhan key tai website Weather API';
```
